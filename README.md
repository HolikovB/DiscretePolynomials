# Discrete polynomials

This project defines and manipulates functions from the finite abelian group **G** (mainly **ℤ/4ℤ × ℤ/4ℤ**) to the circle group **ℝ/ℤ** (represented as `Fraction % 1` in Python). In order to investigate discrete polynomials.

It includes tools to:
- Define arbitrary functions (not necessarily homomorphisms)
- Take **directional derivatives**
- Check if a function is a **discrete polynomial** of degree ≤ *k*

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries (just `fractions` and `itertools`)
